# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

## Collections  

# Not everything is a post or a page. Maybe you want to document the various methods in your open source project, members of a team, or talks at a conference. 
# Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique properties and namespace.

collections:
  cheatsheets:
    output: true

# The corresponding folder is <source>/_cheatsheets

# If you’d like Jekyll to create a public-facing, rendered version of each document in your collection, set the output key to true in your collection metadata  
# http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/


# Default attributes can also be set for a collection
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""  # all pages
      type: cheatsheets
    values:
      layout: inner
      category: "misc"
  - scope:
      path: ""  # all pages
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: inner
